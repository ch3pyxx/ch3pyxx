Hellow everyone!
So i am a beginning python backend developer.
Im 15 ears old and Im from Russia

Id like to start my way with coding small and not really hard games. In the future i would like to become a full-stack wed developer or a software engineer(Yes, I know that the directions are radically different;) )
So I will be glad to everyone who will help me with advice and deeds.
Currently(11/18/2024):
1) I'm planning to download a large (for me personally) game called maze(лабиринт) which is similar to the game Pac Man
2) I also plan to post a prototype (so to speak beta version) of a game called ping pong

in fact, I’m not good at design (I’m really bad at this) so if you have any suggestions for adding or replacing old sounds/pictures/characters and the like, I’ll be only happy))

if you want to help me you 

you can send me your ideas on this telegram user: https://t.me/ch3pyx_try

P.S thank you for your help and attention
